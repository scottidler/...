# If you use Oh-My-Zsh with antidote, load this plugin FIRST to set things up so you
# don't have to worry about whether OMZ will work correctly.

# Regarding OMZ libs - you may choose to use all of OMZ's lib like so:
#   ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh path:lib
# -OR-
# If you really know what you want and nothing else, you might be able to
# choose only the specific libs you need:
#   ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh path:lib/clipboard.zsh
#   ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh path:lib/history.zsh
#   ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh path:lib/completion.zsh
# -OR-
# You may decide not to load anything from lib at all.

# Let's go ahead and use all of Oh My Zsh's lib directory.
# ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh path:lib
